#Add-Ons for svxlinkbuilder
<h1>Here we have the opportunity to add a couple of utilities not previously installed with the svxlinkbuilder.</h1>
<b><p>1. Darkice and Icecast2 Streaming service for the node you have just created.</p></b>
<p><b>2. Installation of the Svxlink PropagationMonitor on the node you have just created.</b> Thanks to Simon G4USP for his contribution of the structure of this code</p>

<p><b>3. Installation of the MessageService</b></p> 
<p>Naturally you will be given the choice.</p>
