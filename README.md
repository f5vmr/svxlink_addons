#Add-Ons for svxlinkbuilder
<h1>Here we have the opportunity to add a couple of utilities not previously installed with the svxlinkbuilder.</h1>
<b><p>1. Darkice and Icecast2 Streaming service for the node you have just created.</p></b>
<p><b>2. Installation of the Svxlink PropagationMonitor on the node you have just created.</b> Thanks to Simon G4USP for his contribution of the structure of this code</p>
<p><b>3. Installation of the MessageService</b></p> 
<p>Naturally you will be given the choice.</p>
<h2>Darkice and Icecast2</h2>
<p>If you have correctly configured your node with svxlinkbuilder, you will be given the choice to install the Darkice and Icecast2 streaming service. The Dummy Soundcard will have already been installed on your node.</p>
<p>It remains for you to configure the Darkice and Icecast2 configuration.</p>
<h2>PropagationMonitor</h2>
<p>Follow the instructions in the script to install the PropagationMonitor on your node.</p>
<h2>MessageService</h2>
<p>sudo nano /etc/svxlink/tclVoiceMail.conf to configure the service.</p>
